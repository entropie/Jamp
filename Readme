Attention:
  I won't continue this version of Jamp.

	(PHP.)Jamp is a working piece of code. Ok, its not the most finest,
	but it does its work. (My music database: ~8500 files in 60 GB atm.)
	I used the PHP version of Jamp for about 2 1/2 years (from the first
	working version which has never been published (thanks God!))

	Actual, I will fix bugs in this version, new features will not come.
	Maybe, this fact will lead this version of Jamp coming up to a final
	`Jamp-1.0.0`.
	BTW, Jamp was written under PHP4 (4.3.1 mostly) and works well with
	PHP5 (tested with 5.0.1).

	I love Jamp, and I love PHP.
	I love all the OO developer, and all the people who makes things going
	the right way, the true way.
	Love, live and if you want, smoke!
